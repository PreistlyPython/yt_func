The answer is you… but too many times, in today’s America, the government wants to be the one to decide.

This happened to Dr. Andrew Fox, and the repercussions were grim.
A Christian minister, Dr. Fox served as his city’s volunteer lead fire chaplain for eight years. He was there for the 1,400 uniformed and civilian members of Austin’s fire department through many difficult times. But in 2022, city officials abruptly ended Dr. Fox’s tenure.

Why? On his personal blog, Dr. Fox expressed his religious view that men and women are biologically different, and men should not compete on women’s sports teams.

Dr. Fox apologized if he offended anyone, but he could not recant his beliefs or apologize for his faith. It wasn’t enough for city officials — they made him turn in his uniform and end his years of voluntary service.

That’s why Dr. Fox reached out to Alliance Defending Freedom, which assisted him in suing the city of Austin for violating his First Amendment rights.

This happened to Dr. Andrew Fox, and the repercussions were grim.
A Christian minister, Dr. Fox served as his city’s volunteer lead fire chaplain for eight years. He was there for the 1,400 uniformed and civilian members of Austin’s fire department through many difficult times. But in 2022, city officials abruptly ended Dr. Fox’s tenure.

Why? On his personal blog, Dr. Fox expressed his religious view that men and women are biologically different, and men should not compete on women’s sports teams.

The answer is you… but too many times, in today’s America, the government wants to be the one to decide.

This happened to Dr. Andrew Fox, and the repercussions were grim.
A Christian minister, Dr. Fox served as his city’s volunteer lead fire chaplain for eight years. He was there for the 1,400 uniformed and civilian members of Austin’s fire department through many difficult times. But in 2022, city officials abruptly ended Dr. Fox’s tenure.

Why? On his personal blog, Dr. Fox expressed his religious view that men and women are biologically different, and men should not compete on women’s sports teams.

Dr. Fox apologized if he offended anyone, but he could not recant his beliefs or apologize for his faith. It wasn’t enough for city officials — they made him turn in his uniform and end his years of voluntary service.

That’s why Dr. Fox reached out to Alliance Defending Freedom, which assisted him in suing the city of Austin for violating his First Amendment rights.

Hi, I'm Dimucc. Video games like COD and Warzone have been slowly heading downhill over the year, but I know there are plenty of Call of Duty players and Gamers who share the same love for video games as I do. That's why I've started making gaming videos to bring some fun and creativity back to the Call of Duty Warzone and Gaming community. I love showcasing how dumb games can get in a sarcastic and humorous way.

I've played Games like Minecraft, GTA V, and Call of Duty for years, whether it be Multiplayer, or even Warzone, I love to give back some of the good memories and funny moments I've experienced to my viewers through my videos!

bPurYj3rcqo,ASMR Videos,xTamIwZFr1s,Educational Content,Live LSD Simulation: “An Interactive Trip” (EDUCATIONAL CONTENT),"Take a visual journey through the potential stages of an Acid Trip’s “Come Up” - all in the name of Education and Harm Reduction. Those curious NO longer need to risk dangerous N-bomb’s or a mentally devastating existential life crisis just to get some eye candy! Of course, the visual experience is a far cry from encapsulating Lucy’s true potential for both good and harm. However, it is one of the primary reasons (mistakes) that can draw the uneducated into a potentially dangerous encounter. 

And that is precisely why I have created this Simulated Experience. I’m hoping after people can get an idea as to what it’s really like, then those looking to trip for the wrong reasons can spare them selves the danger. I’ve even taken things one step further than creating just a simple simulation - this video is also a documentary showcasing a real experience on a LEGAL substitute which is believed to convert into the real thing when taken. 

Please keep in mind that even though I believe most of these replications are SOMEWHAT accurate it is still not a realistic substitution for what one might actually see/experience. It is the best I can do at the moment though, and not to toot my own horn, but some of these effects come pretty close! Others on the other hand are admittedly a little exaggerated (wood doesn’t flow that fast) but that would depend on who you ask. We each have unique brain chemistry, and these compounds affect each of us in a slightly unique way. Meaning it’s impossible to tell someone EXACTLY what they will see. Not to mention no two trips are ever exactly the same.

Anyway, I’ve spent the past two months working on this. I hope you guys can enjoy it!

NtTihXXN8q4,ASMR Videos,xTamIwZFr1s,Educational Content,Live LSD Simulation: “An Interactive Trip” (EDUCATIONAL CONTENT),"Take a visual journey through the potential stages of an Acid Trip’s “Come Up” - all in the name of Education and Harm Reduction. Those curious NO longer need to risk dangerous N-bomb’s or a mentally devastating existential life crisis just to get some eye candy! Of course, the visual experience is a far cry from encapsulating Lucy’s true potential for both good and harm. However, it is one of the primary reasons (mistakes) that can draw the uneducated into a potentially dangerous encounter. 

And that is precisely why I have created this Simulated Experience. I’m hoping after people can get an idea as to what it’s really like, then those looking to trip for the wrong reasons can spare them selves the danger. I’ve even taken things one step further than creating just a simple simulation - this video is also a documentary showcasing a real experience on a LEGAL substitute which is believed to convert into the real thing when taken. 

Please keep in mind that even though I believe most of these replications are SOMEWHAT accurate it is still not a realistic substitution for what one might actually see/experience. It is the best I can do at the moment though, and not to toot my own horn, but some of these effects come pretty close! Others on the other hand are admittedly a little exaggerated (wood doesn’t flow that fast) but that would depend on who you ask. We each have unique brain chemistry, and these compounds affect each of us in a slightly unique way. Meaning it’s impossible to tell someone EXACTLY what they will see. Not to mention no two trips are ever exactly the same.

Anyway, I’ve spent the past two months working on this. I hope you guys can enjoy it!

A Tampa woman who fought off an attacker at her apartment complex's gym is speaking out about her experience in the hopes that other women will feel more empowered.

Nashali Alma, 24, said she was exercising in her complex's gym, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Tampa, in late January when a man who looked familiar to her needed access to the gym, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said.

Alma said she let the man in because she had seen him in the gym before. But as she was working out, Alma told investigators that the man approached her and grabbed her waist. Alma said she yelled at the man to get away from her but he kept chasing her around the gym, police said.

A Tampa woman who fought off an attacker at her apartment complex's gym is speaking out about her experience in the hopes that other women will feel more empowered.

Nashali Alma, 24, said she was exercising in her complex's gym, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Tampa, in late January when a man who looked familiar to her needed access to the gym, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said.

Alma said she let the man in because she had seen him in the gym before. But as she was working out, Alma told investigators that the man approached her and grabbed her waist. Alma said she yelled at the man to get away from her but he kept chasing her around the gym, police said.

It is no wonder that people are looking for ways of keeping their health status. As such people have come up with various ways in which they can do so. Most experts believe that exercise has multiple benefits and the key thing is to ensure that it remains a part of daily activities for a long. A good example is walking or running, both of which help improve and maintain one’s health. Exercise makes one healthy because it develops a strong body. The same can be said of other physical activities such as swimming. Physical activity helps develop muscles and joints as well as other bodily organs especially when one spends much time on the move. Another benefit of exercising is that it improves one’s immunity system. People who take regular exercise can improve their resistance to infection. Regular exercise also aids in decreasing stress levels. People need to maintain good blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol levels to prevent cardiovascular diseases.

Exercise, just like foodstuff, requires proper preparation before consumption. One should not starve while taking exercise in order to reap the maximum benefits. All fruits and vegetables are important during one-week workouts in terms of building muscle mass. These are just some of the exercises that can be performed by one. Other examples include squats, crunches, cycling, and running. Many people feel guilty about not performing regular exercises but they have no reason to think differently; they deserve extra credit for doing regular exercise. In fact, many activities that people use for leisure such as watching movies, playing games, socializing, going to beaches, and relaxing. They should take regular breaks from these and instead work on themselves. However, according to most experts, the main thing to remember when working out is not to stop before you reach your peak fitness level. You may also notice side effects like headaches, high blood pressure, and diabetes among others which could arise if the exercise continues beyond the initial period of time. Therefore, it is always advisable to consult your doctor first and after proper medical supervision, restart the exercise. Similarly, it is best to perform all workouts under strict health monitoring in order to avoid injury and unwanted side effects that could lead to permanent problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

It is no wonder that people are looking for ways of keeping their health status. As such people have come up with various ways in which they can do so. Most experts believe that exercise has multiple benefits and the key thing is to ensure that it remains a part of daily activities for a long. A good example is walking or running, both of which help improve and maintain one’s health. Exercise makes one healthy because it develops a strong body. The same can be said of other physical activities such as swimming. Physical activity helps develop muscles and joints as well as other bodily organs especially when one spends much time on the move. Another benefit of exercising is that it improves one’s immunity system. People who take regular exercise can improve their resistance to infection. Regular exercise also aids in decreasing stress levels. People need to maintain good blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol levels to prevent cardiovascular diseases.

Exercise, just like foodstuff, requires proper preparation before consumption. One should not starve while taking exercise in order to reap the maximum benefits. All fruits and vegetables are important during one-week workouts in terms of building muscle mass. These are just some of the exercises that can be performed by one. Other examples include squats, crunches, cycling, and running. Many people feel guilty about not performing regular exercises but they have no reason to think differently; they deserve extra credit for doing regular exercise. In fact, many activities that people use for leisure such as watching movies, playing games, socializing, going to beaches, and relaxing. They should take regular breaks from these and instead work on themselves. However, according to most experts, the main thing to remember when working out is not to stop before you reach your peak fitness level. You may also notice side effects like headaches, high blood pressure, and diabetes among others which could arise if the exercise continues beyond the initial period of time. Therefore, it is always advisable to consult your doctor first and after proper medical supervision, restart the exercise. Similarly, it is best to perform all workouts under strict health monitoring in order to avoid injury and unwanted side effects that could lead to permanent problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

A Tampa woman who fought off an attacker at her apartment complex's gym is speaking out about her experience in the hopes that other women will feel more empowered.

Nashali Alma, 24, said she was exercising in her complex's gym, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Tampa, in late January when a man who looked familiar to her needed access to the gym, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said.

Alma said she let the man in because she had seen him in the gym before. But as she was working out, Alma told investigators that the man approached her and grabbed her waist. Alma said she yelled at the man to get away from her but he kept chasing her around the gym, police said.

#NewYorkCity is an international metropolis built on the shoulders of immigrants and their descendants.

The city is home to eight million people, and receives more than 50 million visitors per year. Your New York City #vacation should include sampling the food of hundreds of different cultures. You can easily #explore on foot, by taxi, or via the famous subway system.

No New York #sightseeing is complete without a visit to Times Square, which you’ve no doubt seen in many movies. Take in its billboards, its many people, and its food, then cross over to Central Park, which comprises 850 acres of lakes and meadows, and is the setting for many a romantic comedy. 

You also have your pick of art and history museums, as well as the Reflecting Absence Memorial and Museum, where you can pay your respects to the victims of 9/11.


For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

#NewYorkCity is an international metropolis built on the shoulders of immigrants and their descendants.

The city is home to eight million people, and receives more than 50 million visitors per year. Your New York City #vacation should include sampling the food of hundreds of different cultures. You can easily #explore on foot, by taxi, or via the famous subway system.

No New York #sightseeing is complete without a visit to Times Square, which you’ve no doubt seen in many movies. Take in its billboards, its many people, and its food, then cross over to Central Park, which comprises 850 acres of lakes and meadows, and is the setting for many a romantic comedy. 

You also have your pick of art and history museums, as well as the Reflecting Absence Memorial and Museum, where you can pay your respects to the victims of 9/11.


For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

#NewYorkCity is an international metropolis built on the shoulders of immigrants and their descendants.

The city is home to eight million people, and receives more than 50 million visitors per year. Your New York City #vacation should include sampling the food of hundreds of different cultures. You can easily #explore on foot, by taxi, or via the famous subway system.

No New York #sightseeing is complete without a visit to Times Square, which you’ve no doubt seen in many movies. Take in its billboards, its many people, and its food, then cross over to Central Park, which comprises 850 acres of lakes and meadows, and is the setting for many a romantic comedy. 

You also have your pick of art and history museums, as well as the Reflecting Absence Memorial and Museum, where you can pay your respects to the victims of 9/11.

Leave the regular world behind when you step into the fog-swathed “City by the Bay.” From shopping adventures in Union Square to a trip on the city’s legendary cable cars, a #vacation to #SanFrancisco is bound to leave you with incredible memories.

If it’s a more serene environment you’re after, pass through the stately architecture and flowing lagoon of the Palace of Fine Arts. 

Of course, San Francisco #sightseeing isn’t complete without an excursion to Alcatraz, the island prison that once held some of the country’s most notorious criminals. Look into its empty cells and thick stone walls and wonder, could you escape “The Rock”?

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

#NewYorkCity is an international metropolis built on the shoulders of immigrants and their descendants.

The city is home to eight million people, and receives more than 50 million visitors per year. Your New York City #vacation should include sampling the food of hundreds of different cultures. You can easily #explore on foot, by taxi, or via the famous subway system.

No New York #sightseeing is complete without a visit to Times Square, which you’ve no doubt seen in many movies. Take in its billboards, its many people, and its food, then cross over to Central Park, which comprises 850 acres of lakes and meadows, and is the setting for many a romantic comedy. 

You also have your pick of art and history museums, as well as the Reflecting Absence Memorial and Museum, where you can pay your respects to the victims of 9/11.


For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

#NewYorkCity is an international metropolis built on the shoulders of immigrants and their descendants.

The city is home to eight million people, and receives more than 50 million visitors per year. Your New York City #vacation should include sampling the food of hundreds of different cultures. You can easily #explore on foot, by taxi, or via the famous subway system.

No New York #sightseeing is complete without a visit to Times Square, which you’ve no doubt seen in many movies. Take in its billboards, its many people, and its food, then cross over to Central Park, which comprises 850 acres of lakes and meadows, and is the setting for many a romantic comedy. 

You also have your pick of art and history museums, as well as the Reflecting Absence Memorial and Museum, where you can pay your respects to the victims of 9/11.


For now, we hope you enjoy watching this #travel #guide as much as we enjoyed making it.

Which piece 1-4 is your favorite!? ✨ the 4th one is an actual top, but you can also style it under other pieces as well 🤍

Today’s affirmation:
“I let go of things that no longer serve me to make space for new beginnings” 🤍

Memo: I’m styling them under a deep open-front jumpsuit so you can get a full look of the pieces, but feel free to style under more covered tops.  Love styling these pieces under button ups, and some of the pieces even over bralettes and tops! 

The right body chain can absolutely elevate your entire look! Here’s part III of different body chains I’ve been wearing recently, and you can see how each piece uniquely styles the deep v blazer in different ways.  My favorite way to style this pieces is with a more classic outfit, making it the perfect amount of sexy & classy!

https://liketk.it/48eoi

Which piece 1-4 is your favorite!? ✨ the 4th one is an actual top, but you can also style it under other pieces as well 🤍

Today’s affirmation:
“I let go of things that no longer serve me to make space for new beginnings” 🤍

Memo: I’m styling them under a deep open-front jumpsuit so you can get a full look of the pieces, but feel free to style under more covered tops.  Love styling these pieces under button ups, and some of the pieces even over bralettes and tops! 

The right body chain can absolutely elevate your entire look! Here’s part III of different body chains I’ve been wearing recently, and you can see how each piece uniquely styles the deep v blazer in different ways.  My favorite way to style this pieces is with a more classic outfit, making it the perfect amount of sexy & classy!

About Key & Peele: 
Key & Peele showcases the fearless wit of stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as the duo takes on everything from ""Gremlins 2"" to systemic racism. With an array of sketches as wide-reaching as they are cringingly accurate, the pair has created a bevy of classic characters, including Wendell, the players of the East/West Bowl and President Obama's Anger Translator.

This simple family from San Diego said goodbye to their normal life as Jorge and Alexa auditioned for America’s Got Talent, performed everywhere from ""The Ellen Degeneres Show"" to China, and showed the world the importance of family. Their original heart-warming rendition of the song has received over 30 million views on YouTube, and continues to be one of the world’s favorite videos. Today, the Narvaez family invites you to join them as they share their love of music, community, Hispanic culture and art with the world.

Their original heart-warming rendition of the song has received over 30 million views on YouTube, and continues to be one of the world’s favorite videos. Today, the Narvaez family invites you to join them as they share their love of music, community, Hispanic culture and art with the world.

kDYMizH73cc,ASMR Videos,kDYMizH73cc,Podcasts and Interviews,Will Smith's LIFE ADVICE On Manifesting Success Will CHANGE YOUR LIFE  | Jay Shetty,"Will Smith is an actor, producer and musician, two-time Academy Award nominee, Grammy Award and NAACP award winner who has enjoyed a diverse career encompassing films, television and multi platinum records. Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I Am Legend, the Bad Boys and Men in Black film series, Aladdin and Hitch. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness and Concussion.

Today, I sit down with Will Smith to talk about his commitment to family, straying away from his father’s military mindset in search of true happiness, and how to live the golden rule - to treat others how you want to be treated.

00:47 Today, Jay Shetty welcomes his dear friend, Will Smith as they reminisce about the happy times and adventures they spent together, and how their friendship flourished as Will studies the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.

07:00 Jay asks Will: “Tell us a bit about what you learned from your parents and how you were able to process it positively? It’s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts. 

12:02 Jay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart. It’s never easy to live with a military mindset yet even with success and fame it didn’t feel like true happiness.

17:29 Jay asks listeners to put their minds in the middle path while Will suggests learning from an athlete’s mindset and level of discipline to manifest the things that they want in their life. 

20:11 Jay mentions how Will’s grandmother had a huge impact in his life. It's all about finding peace by living your life in service. His parents, on the other hand, had different principles and pushed for totally different things, yet they showed him how life should be lived. 

25:14 Jay talks about the hard work Will had to do that people don’t really see. A lot of people have not seen the learning accumulated through hard work, the sacrifices made along the way, and the military mindset that Will cradled so deeply within.

32:06 Jay points out that most superheroes get their powers when bad things happen to them. This is also true for everyone, that most of our experiences happen to teach us a lesson. Will then added that there is no such thing as a bad experience.

35:57 Jay taps into Will’s last moments with his father and how he coped with the loss. The lesson learned from the experience is to always be genuine with your every “Hello” and “Goodbye”, who knows it could be the last.

42:51 Jay asks Will about how the tradition to learn new religion every year, how this strengthened his bond with Jada, and the lessons learned while studying these different religions.

49:07 Jay talks to Will about the wisdom within books, how past people had lived through the same problems that most of us are dealing with today. Treating people the way you want to be treated is essential in maintaining peaceful relationships around you.

54:53 Jay explains the Analogy of the Mirror wherein people become so disconnected from nature that everything becomes instant and our mindset has become NOW whereas nature is never instant. 

56:29 Jay shares the first time he communicated with Will. It surprised him how Will can be so committed to the things he sets his mind on. And that prompted Jay to relearn and fall back in love with the things he fell in love years ago. Commitment is changing yourself through constant practice.

58:54 Will explains why the central focus of his life is having a successful love relationship. This determination came after his experience with his parents divorce. He continues to seek knowledge on achieving this goal. 

01:01:28 Will discusses why the concepts of ignorance and delusion are always the center of problems in every human relationship. All issues within human relations stem from a lack of understanding.

01:07:59 Will retells his unforgettable encounter with Nelson Mandela and how he was offered to be his student about life struggles. 

01:13:42 Jay is curious why Will is so moved by the Story of Arjun. Will eagerly explains the story and why it resonated with so much.  

01:21:06 Jay explains that most of us are living our life based on the result of our actions, which we think is a sign of success. We shouldn’t be living a life based on the possible results of our actions, instead we should live for ourselves and our own happiness.

01:26:25 Jay and Will agree on this: It's not a problem if you have comprehension of what's happening around you. You don't call things problems that you have complete comprehension of.

01:31:05 Will relives his character as The Genie, a character so similar to his personality, his core. The concept of the sacred clown, the singing, dancing, and joy it brings, is beautiful conduit for the ideas.

ZjIRYn7x8sk,ASMR Videos,kDYMizH73cc,Podcasts and Interviews,Will Smith's LIFE ADVICE On Manifesting Success Will CHANGE YOUR LIFE  | Jay Shetty,"Will Smith is an actor, producer and musician, two-time Academy Award nominee, Grammy Award and NAACP award winner who has enjoyed a diverse career encompassing films, television and multi platinum records. Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I Am Legend, the Bad Boys and Men in Black film series, Aladdin and Hitch. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness and Concussion.

Today, I sit down with Will Smith to talk about his commitment to family, straying away from his father’s military mindset in search of true happiness, and how to live the golden rule - to treat others how you want to be treated.

00:47 Today, Jay Shetty welcomes his dear friend, Will Smith as they reminisce about the happy times and adventures they spent together, and how their friendship flourished as Will studies the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.

07:00 Jay asks Will: “Tell us a bit about what you learned from your parents and how you were able to process it positively? It’s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts. 

12:02 Jay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart. It’s never easy to live with a military mindset yet even with success and fame it didn’t feel like true happiness.

17:29 Jay asks listeners to put their minds in the middle path while Will suggests learning from an athlete’s mindset and level of discipline to manifest the things that they want in their life. 

20:11 Jay mentions how Will’s grandmother had a huge impact in his life. It's all about finding peace by living your life in service. His parents, on the other hand, had different principles and pushed for totally different things, yet they showed him how life should be lived. 

25:14 Jay talks about the hard work Will had to do that people don’t really see. A lot of people have not seen the learning accumulated through hard work, the sacrifices made along the way, and the military mindset that Will cradled so deeply within.

32:06 Jay points out that most superheroes get their powers when bad things happen to them. This is also true for everyone, that most of our experiences happen to teach us a lesson. Will then added that there is no such thing as a bad experience.

35:57 Jay taps into Will’s last moments with his father and how he coped with the loss. The lesson learned from the experience is to always be genuine with your every “Hello” and “Goodbye”, who knows it could be the last.

42:51 Jay asks Will about how the tradition to learn new religion every year, how this strengthened his bond with Jada, and the lessons learned while studying these different religions.

49:07 Jay talks to Will about the wisdom within books, how past people had lived through the same problems that most of us are dealing with today. Treating people the way you want to be treated is essential in maintaining peaceful relationships around you.

54:53 Jay explains the Analogy of the Mirror wherein people become so disconnected from nature that everything becomes instant and our mindset has become NOW whereas nature is never instant. 

56:29 Jay shares the first time he communicated with Will. It surprised him how Will can be so committed to the things he sets his mind on. And that prompted Jay to relearn and fall back in love with the things he fell in love years ago. Commitment is changing yourself through constant practice.

58:54 Will explains why the central focus of his life is having a successful love relationship. This determination came after his experience with his parents divorce. He continues to seek knowledge on achieving this goal. 

01:01:28 Will discusses why the concepts of ignorance and delusion are always the center of problems in every human relationship. All issues within human relations stem from a lack of understanding.

01:07:59 Will retells his unforgettable encounter with Nelson Mandela and how he was offered to be his student about life struggles. 

01:13:42 Jay is curious why Will is so moved by the Story of Arjun. Will eagerly explains the story and why it resonated with so much.  

01:21:06 Jay explains that most of us are living our life based on the result of our actions, which we think is a sign of success. We shouldn’t be living a life based on the possible results of our actions, instead we should live for ourselves and our own happiness.

01:26:25 Jay and Will agree on this: It's not a problem if you have comprehension of what's happening around you. You don't call things problems that you have complete comprehension of.

01:31:05 Will relives his character as The Genie, a character so similar to his personality, his core. The concept of the sacred clown, the singing, dancing, and joy it brings, is beautiful conduit for the ideas.

Kendall is a successful business founder, international supermodel, founder of the incredibly successful tequila brand, 818, and star on the Hulu’s, the Kardashians, which premieres in second season on September 22nd. 

Kendal shows us a different side of her as she shares how her curiosity for people with brilliant minds and doing so much to give back to the world has eventually led to this interview. Behind the glamor and spotlight, she especially enjoys having some time alone with herself, and she values the importance of setting boundaries and why we should do things that lead to genuine happiness. We talk about her childhood and her love for animals, how the simple things give her the most joys, getting through grief after losing a dear friend, and finding the heart to be more kind to your inner child.

Kendall remains grounded and in tune with her inner goddess and not letting negativity and ill intentions change who she is, who she may become, and the purpose she is living by.  


What We Discuss:
00:00:00 Intro

OcISVEh1jyw,ASMR Videos,kDYMizH73cc,Podcasts and Interviews,Will Smith's LIFE ADVICE On Manifesting Success Will CHANGE YOUR LIFE  | Jay Shetty,"Will Smith is an actor, producer and musician, two-time Academy Award nominee, Grammy Award and NAACP award winner who has enjoyed a diverse career encompassing films, television and multi platinum records. Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I Am Legend, the Bad Boys and Men in Black film series, Aladdin and Hitch. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness and Concussion.

Today, I sit down with Will Smith to talk about his commitment to family, straying away from his father’s military mindset in search of true happiness, and how to live the golden rule - to treat others how you want to be treated.

00:47 Today, Jay Shetty welcomes his dear friend, Will Smith as they reminisce about the happy times and adventures they spent together, and how their friendship flourished as Will studies the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.

07:00 Jay asks Will: “Tell us a bit about what you learned from your parents and how you were able to process it positively? It’s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts. 

12:02 Jay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart. It’s never easy to live with a military mindset yet even with success and fame it didn’t feel like true happiness.

17:29 Jay asks listeners to put their minds in the middle path while Will suggests learning from an athlete’s mindset and level of discipline to manifest the things that they want in their life. 

20:11 Jay mentions how Will’s grandmother had a huge impact in his life. It's all about finding peace by living your life in service. His parents, on the other hand, had different principles and pushed for totally different things, yet they showed him how life should be lived. 

25:14 Jay talks about the hard work Will had to do that people don’t really see. A lot of people have not seen the learning accumulated through hard work, the sacrifices made along the way, and the military mindset that Will cradled so deeply within.

32:06 Jay points out that most superheroes get their powers when bad things happen to them. This is also true for everyone, that most of our experiences happen to teach us a lesson. Will then added that there is no such thing as a bad experience.

35:57 Jay taps into Will’s last moments with his father and how he coped with the loss. The lesson learned from the experience is to always be genuine with your every “Hello” and “Goodbye”, who knows it could be the last.

42:51 Jay asks Will about how the tradition to learn new religion every year, how this strengthened his bond with Jada, and the lessons learned while studying these different religions.

49:07 Jay talks to Will about the wisdom within books, how past people had lived through the same problems that most of us are dealing with today. Treating people the way you want to be treated is essential in maintaining peaceful relationships around you.

54:53 Jay explains the Analogy of the Mirror wherein people become so disconnected from nature that everything becomes instant and our mindset has become NOW whereas nature is never instant. 

56:29 Jay shares the first time he communicated with Will. It surprised him how Will can be so committed to the things he sets his mind on. And that prompted Jay to relearn and fall back in love with the things he fell in love years ago. Commitment is changing yourself through constant practice.

58:54 Will explains why the central focus of his life is having a successful love relationship. This determination came after his experience with his parents divorce. He continues to seek knowledge on achieving this goal. 

01:01:28 Will discusses why the concepts of ignorance and delusion are always the center of problems in every human relationship. All issues within human relations stem from a lack of understanding.

01:07:59 Will retells his unforgettable encounter with Nelson Mandela and how he was offered to be his student about life struggles. 

01:13:42 Jay is curious why Will is so moved by the Story of Arjun. Will eagerly explains the story and why it resonated with so much.  

01:21:06 Jay explains that most of us are living our life based on the result of our actions, which we think is a sign of success. We shouldn’t be living a life based on the possible results of our actions, instead we should live for ourselves and our own happiness.

01:26:25 Jay and Will agree on this: It's not a problem if you have comprehension of what's happening around you. You don't call things problems that you have complete comprehension of.

01:31:05 Will relives his character as The Genie, a character so similar to his personality, his core. The concept of the sacred clown, the singing, dancing, and joy it brings, is beautiful conduit for the ideas.

Kendall is a successful business founder, international supermodel, founder of the incredibly successful tequila brand, 818, and star on the Hulu’s, the Kardashians, which premieres in second season on September 22nd. 

Kendal shows us a different side of her as she shares how her curiosity for people with brilliant minds and doing so much to give back to the world has eventually led to this interview. Behind the glamor and spotlight, she especially enjoys having some time alone with herself, and she values the importance of setting boundaries and why we should do things that lead to genuine happiness. We talk about her childhood and her love for animals, how the simple things give her the most joys, getting through grief after losing a dear friend, and finding the heart to be more kind to your inner child.

Kendall remains grounded and in tune with her inner goddess and not letting negativity and ill intentions change who she is, who she may become, and the purpose she is living by.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas RETURNS on The Ranveer Show, the biggest Mega superstar in Bollywood and Hollywood. We had a gorgeous conversation with her just like last time, her warmth is something I absolutely love. In this episode, we spoke about her goals and their manifestation, how she made it big in a new country where nobody knew her, her thoughts on being famous and so much more. Her new brand Anomaly which is a haircare-based lineup launched in India in collaboration with Nykaa, spoke about her entrepreneurial journey, what she wishes to achieve with her Anomaly and more.

Priyanka Chopra is someone who can make you leave your bed and get back to working hard towards your goals. Out of everything she has ever achieved or will achieve in the future, it is her unbelievable zest to work hard that makes her who she is. Mindset and execution are everything.

""Everyone has struggles, I don't like to be a victim"" - Priyanka Chopra

Lastly, our humble request to Priyanka and the team is that she comes and visits our studio in our office space, we will be more than honoured. I wish to manifest this today.
Our 12th episode of TRS was with Priyanka Chopra and that was our 1st ever big profile podcast, which changed TRS forever. We wish to pay back her in some way in the future. Always rooting for ya, PCJ.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas RETURNS on The Ranveer Show, the biggest Mega superstar in Bollywood and Hollywood. We had a gorgeous conversation with her just like last time, her warmth is something I absolutely love. In this episode, we spoke about her goals and their manifestation, how she made it big in a new country where nobody knew her, her thoughts on being famous and so much more. Her new brand Anomaly which is a haircare-based lineup launched in India in collaboration with Nykaa, spoke about her entrepreneurial journey, what she wishes to achieve with her Anomaly and more.

Priyanka Chopra is someone who can make you leave your bed and get back to working hard towards your goals. Out of everything she has ever achieved or will achieve in the future, it is her unbelievable zest to work hard that makes her who she is. Mindset and execution are everything.

""Everyone has struggles, I don't like to be a victim"" - Priyanka Chopra

Lastly, our humble request to Priyanka and the team is that she comes and visits our studio in our office space, we will be more than honoured. I wish to manifest this today.
Our 12th episode of TRS was with Priyanka Chopra and that was our 1st ever big profile podcast, which changed TRS forever. We wish to pay back her in some way in the future. Always rooting for ya, PCJ.

Today’s show is like sitting on the back porch in New Orleans just chopping it up with your uncles and reminiscing about the journey through the untold stories except we are in LA and it’s after midnight, but any chance to sit with Lil Wayne is one we make happen. 

Reconnecting with his Louisiana roots, Ryan is excited to have Weezy join him, Fred and Channing to talk about life, lessons, losses and making music along the way.

Becoming one of music’s biggest icons over three decades, Lil Wayne says he’s never worked a day in his life because everything he’s done in music is for the love of it. 
Storying his journey from starting at 7 yrs old to now, talking about the highs and lows of his career, sharing the untold stories, the ins and outs of life changing experiences, his time in prison, the night an off duty police officer saved his life and how he’s maintained and sustained success at the highest level in the industry all the while earning the praise and accolades from fans and his peers. 

Never for the money and always for the respect, Lil Wayne Flashes back to childhood days of when he first started in music and reflecting back on how his mom and grandma supported him from day one not just to pursue music but more importantly to always be a good man and one he could be proud of.

This conversation is a side of Lil Wayne we don’t get to see very often as he let down his walls and opened up like never before.

XuaWwmixSMA,ASMR Videos,kDYMizH73cc,Podcasts and Interviews,Will Smith's LIFE ADVICE On Manifesting Success Will CHANGE YOUR LIFE  | Jay Shetty,"Will Smith is an actor, producer and musician, two-time Academy Award nominee, Grammy Award and NAACP award winner who has enjoyed a diverse career encompassing films, television and multi platinum records. Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I Am Legend, the Bad Boys and Men in Black film series, Aladdin and Hitch. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness and Concussion.

Today, I sit down with Will Smith to talk about his commitment to family, straying away from his father’s military mindset in search of true happiness, and how to live the golden rule - to treat others how you want to be treated.

00:47 Today, Jay Shetty welcomes his dear friend, Will Smith as they reminisce about the happy times and adventures they spent together, and how their friendship flourished as Will studies the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.

07:00 Jay asks Will: “Tell us a bit about what you learned from your parents and how you were able to process it positively? It’s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts. 

12:02 Jay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart. It’s never easy to live with a military mindset yet even with success and fame it didn’t feel like true happiness.

17:29 Jay asks listeners to put their minds in the middle path while Will suggests learning from an athlete’s mindset and level of discipline to manifest the things that they want in their life. 

20:11 Jay mentions how Will’s grandmother had a huge impact in his life. It's all about finding peace by living your life in service. His parents, on the other hand, had different principles and pushed for totally different things, yet they showed him how life should be lived. 

25:14 Jay talks about the hard work Will had to do that people don’t really see. A lot of people have not seen the learning accumulated through hard work, the sacrifices made along the way, and the military mindset that Will cradled so deeply within.

32:06 Jay points out that most superheroes get their powers when bad things happen to them. This is also true for everyone, that most of our experiences happen to teach us a lesson. Will then added that there is no such thing as a bad experience.

35:57 Jay taps into Will’s last moments with his father and how he coped with the loss. The lesson learned from the experience is to always be genuine with your every “Hello” and “Goodbye”, who knows it could be the last.

42:51 Jay asks Will about how the tradition to learn new religion every year, how this strengthened his bond with Jada, and the lessons learned while studying these different religions.

49:07 Jay talks to Will about the wisdom within books, how past people had lived through the same problems that most of us are dealing with today. Treating people the way you want to be treated is essential in maintaining peaceful relationships around you.

54:53 Jay explains the Analogy of the Mirror wherein people become so disconnected from nature that everything becomes instant and our mindset has become NOW whereas nature is never instant. 

56:29 Jay shares the first time he communicated with Will. It surprised him how Will can be so committed to the things he sets his mind on. And that prompted Jay to relearn and fall back in love with the things he fell in love years ago. Commitment is changing yourself through constant practice.

58:54 Will explains why the central focus of his life is having a successful love relationship. This determination came after his experience with his parents divorce. He continues to seek knowledge on achieving this goal. 

01:01:28 Will discusses why the concepts of ignorance and delusion are always the center of problems in every human relationship. All issues within human relations stem from a lack of understanding.

01:07:59 Will retells his unforgettable encounter with Nelson Mandela and how he was offered to be his student about life struggles. 

01:13:42 Jay is curious why Will is so moved by the Story of Arjun. Will eagerly explains the story and why it resonated with so much.  

01:21:06 Jay explains that most of us are living our life based on the result of our actions, which we think is a sign of success. We shouldn’t be living a life based on the possible results of our actions, instead we should live for ourselves and our own happiness.

01:26:25 Jay and Will agree on this: It's not a problem if you have comprehension of what's happening around you. You don't call things problems that you have complete comprehension of.

01:31:05 Will relives his character as The Genie, a character so similar to his personality, his core. The concept of the sacred clown, the singing, dancing, and joy it brings, is beautiful conduit for the ideas.

XuaWwmixSMA,ASMR Videos,ZjIRYn7x8sk,Podcasts and Interviews,"KENDALL JENNER Opens Up About Anxiety, Insecurity, & How To Be Truly Happy! | Jay Shetty","Today, I sit down with the one and only Kendall Jenner. Kendall is a successful business founder, international supermodel, founder of the incredibly successful tequila brand, 818, and star on the Hulu’s, the Kardashians, which premieres in second season on September 22nd. 

Kendal shows us a different side of her as she shares how her curiosity for people with brilliant minds and doing so much to give back to the world has eventually led to this interview. Behind the glamor and spotlight, she especially enjoys having some time alone with herself, and she values the importance of setting boundaries and why we should do things that lead to genuine happiness. We talk about her childhood and her love for animals, how the simple things give her the most joys, getting through grief after losing a dear friend, and finding the heart to be more kind to your inner child.

Kendall remains grounded and in tune with her inner goddess and not letting negativity and ill intentions change who she is, who she may become, and the purpose she is living by.  


What We Discuss:
00:00:00 Intro
00:00:26 “I think I manifested this interview…”
00:09:53 “I grew up in a horse community.”
00:15:42 Craving the simple things
00:18:51 Setting boundaries for yourself  
00:21:46 Putting yourself first
00:27:15 It’s important to be happy
00:28:51 Reassuring yourself of who you really are
00:33:06 Sometimes, family can be overwhelming

Today’s show is like sitting on the back porch in New Orleans just chopping it up with your uncles and reminiscing about the journey through the untold stories except we are in LA and it’s after midnight, but any chance to sit with Lil Wayne is one we make happen. 

Reconnecting with his Louisiana roots, Ryan is excited to have Weezy join him, Fred and Channing to talk about life, lessons, losses and making music along the way.

Becoming one of music’s biggest icons over three decades, Lil Wayne says he’s never worked a day in his life because everything he’s done in music is for the love of it. 
Storying his journey from starting at 7 yrs old to now, talking about the highs and lows of his career, sharing the untold stories, the ins and outs of life changing experiences, his time in prison, the night an off duty police officer saved his life and how he’s maintained and sustained success at the highest level in the industry all the while earning the praise and accolades from fans and his peers. 

Never for the money and always for the respect, Lil Wayne Flashes back to childhood days of when he first started in music and reflecting back on how his mom and grandma supported him from day one not just to pursue music but more importantly to always be a good man and one he could be proud of.

This conversation is a side of Lil Wayne we don’t get to see very often as he let down his walls and opened up like never before.

""Priyanka Chopra Motivational Speech about Identity of Person #missioninspired #shorts #shortvideo ""
Priyanka Chopra is an Indian actress, producer, model and singer. The winner of the Miss World 2000 pageant, Chopra is one of India's highest-paid actresses. She has received numerous accolades, including two National Film Award and five Filmfare Awards. In 2016, the Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri, and Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and in the next two years, Forbes listed her among the World's 100 Most Powerful Women.

Although Chopra initially aspired to study aeronautical engineering, she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, opportunities which arose as a result of her pageant wins. She made her acting debut in the Tamil film Thamizhan (2002). She then made her Bollywood debut in The Hero: Love Story of a Spy (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and received critical acclaim for her breakout role in the 2004 thriller Aitraaz. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions Krrish and Don (both 2006), and she later reprised her role in their sequels.

It’s the animal dance!
Let’s all stand up
And move around
And clap our hands! 
Look over there!  Our friend the wolf!
He goes: ""Howl, howl, howl, howl!""
Doing the animal dance!

It’s the animal dance! 
Let’s all stand up
And move around 
And clap our hands!
Look over there!  Our friend the cat!
He goes: ""Meow, meow, meow, meow!""
Doing the animal dance!

It’s the animal dance!
Let’s all stand up
And move around

Ms Rachel has packed so much important learning into this “Learn Animals with Ms Rachel” special! Not only does she teach farm animals, animal sounds, zoo animals, and baby animal names, she sneaks in learning concepts to prepare children for preschool, such as modeling “what questions,” gestures, first words, first sentences, 5 W Questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why) pretend play skills, counting, colors, shapes, numbers, letters and letter sounds! She includes fun nursery rhymes & kids songs that encourage movement and language development. She also teaches prepositions such as under, next to, on, behind, in and out! As always, you can count on Ms Rachel to encourage language, movement and engagement. She is a master at encouraging speech and making screen time active, not passive. This kind of screen time is more beneficial. Ms Rachel uses fun learning toys to engage and excite toddlers about learning and encourage speech.

The learning standards and milestones she encourages range from 9 month old milestones like clapping to 5 year old milestones such as using the words and phrases “behind” and “next to” correctly and asking and answering “why questions.” Young children will be challenged to learn more and older siblings can watch and learn together with little ones. “Songs for Littles” is better screen time for bright toddlers! Buzz Feed called it “The best educational YouTube channel!” 

If your child is not meeting milestones, let your pediatrician know and call Early Intervention for your state. Your child may qualify for free or very low cost therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy. You can also contact a private speech therapist (speech language pathologist) for an evaluation. It’s best to act early and get your child help as soon as possible.

Old Macdonald Had A Farm
Five Little Ducks

Ms Rachel has packed so much important learning into this “Learn Animals with Ms Rachel” special! Not only does she teach farm animals, animal sounds, zoo animals, and baby animal names, she sneaks in learning concepts to prepare children for preschool, such as modeling “what questions,” gestures, first words, first sentences, 5 W Questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why) pretend play skills, counting, colors, shapes, numbers, letters and letter sounds! She includes fun nursery rhymes & kids songs that encourage movement and language development. She also teaches prepositions such as under, next to, on, behind, in and out! As always, you can count on Ms Rachel to encourage language, movement and engagement. She is a master at encouraging speech and making screen time active, not passive. This kind of screen time is more beneficial. Ms Rachel uses fun learning toys to engage and excite toddlers about learning and encourage speech.

The learning standards and milestones she encourages range from 9 month old milestones like clapping to 5 year old milestones such as using the words and phrases “behind” and “next to” correctly and asking and answering “why questions.” Young children will be challenged to learn more and older siblings can watch and learn together with little ones. “Songs for Littles” is better screen time for bright toddlers! Buzz Feed called it “The best educational YouTube channel!” 

If your child is not meeting milestones, let your pediatrician know and call Early Intervention for your state.

Hmm…           
Oh! A kangaroo!

Ms Rachel has packed so much important learning into this “Learn Animals with Ms Rachel” special! Not only does she teach farm animals, animal sounds, zoo animals, and baby animal names, she sneaks in learning concepts to prepare children for preschool, such as modeling “what questions,” gestures, first words, first sentences, 5 W Questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why) pretend play skills, counting, colors, shapes, numbers, letters and letter sounds! She includes fun nursery rhymes & kids songs that encourage movement and language development. She also teaches prepositions such as under, next to, on, behind, in and out! As always, you can count on Ms Rachel to encourage language, movement and engagement. She is a master at encouraging speech and making screen time active, not passive. This kind of screen time is more beneficial. Ms Rachel uses fun learning toys to engage and excite toddlers about learning and encourage speech.

The learning standards and milestones she encourages range from 9 month old milestones like clapping to 5 year old milestones such as using the words and phrases “behind” and “next to” correctly and asking and answering “why questions.” Young children will be challenged to learn more and older siblings can watch and learn together with little ones. “Songs for Littles” is better screen time for bright toddlers! Buzz Feed called it “The best educational YouTube channel!” 

If your child is not meeting milestones, let your pediatrician know and call Early Intervention for your state. Your child may qualify for free or very low cost therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy. You can also contact a private speech therapist (speech language pathologist) for an evaluation. It’s best to act early and get your child help as soon as possible. 

Songs in this video include: 

Old Macdonald Had A Farm
Five Little Ducks 
Mary Had A Little Lamb 
Walkin’ At The Zoo 
If You Should Meet An Elephant 
Hop Little Bunnies 
Tick Tock Cuckoo Clock 
5 Little Monkeys
Bananas Unite 
Do You Know What Shape This Is? 
Row, Row, Row Your Boat
Bingo 
Little Bo Peep 
1-20 Song

Plus more! 

Ms Rachel also teaches about taking care of our pets and being gentle with our pets! She teaches children about veterinarians. She also shows real pets and animals throughout the episode. The Old Macdonald Had A Farm with real animals will delight children and the Old MacDonald Baby Animals. Learn, grow and play along with Ms Rachel! Ms Rachel also learns about jungle animals and forest animals.

The learning standards and milestones she encourages range from 9 month old milestones like clapping to 5 year old milestones such as using the words and phrases “behind” and “next to” correctly and asking and answering “why questions.” Young children will be challenged to learn more and older siblings can watch and learn together with little ones. “Songs for Littles” is better screen time for bright toddlers! Buzz Feed called it “The best educational YouTube channel!” 

If your child is not meeting milestones, let your pediatrician know and call Early Intervention for your state. Your child may qualify for free or very low cost therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy. You can also contact a private speech therapist (speech language pathologist) for an evaluation. It’s best to act early and get your child help as soon as possible.

Ms Rachel has packed so much important learning into this “Learn Animals with Ms Rachel” special! Not only does she teach farm animals, animal sounds, zoo animals, and baby animal names, she sneaks in learning concepts to prepare children for preschool, such as modeling “what questions,” gestures, first words, first sentences, 5 W Questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why) pretend play skills, counting, colors, shapes, numbers, letters and letter sounds! She includes fun nursery rhymes & kids songs that encourage movement and language development. She also teaches prepositions such as under, next to, on, behind, in and out! As always, you can count on Ms Rachel to encourage language, movement and engagement. She is a master at encouraging speech and making screen time active, not passive. This kind of screen time is more beneficial. Ms Rachel uses fun learning toys to engage and excite toddlers about learning and encourage speech.

The learning standards and milestones she encourages range from 9 month old milestones like clapping to 5 year old milestones such as using the words and phrases “behind” and “next to” correctly and asking and answering “why questions.” Young children will be challenged to learn more and older siblings can watch and learn together with little ones. “Songs for Littles” is better screen time for bright toddlers! Buzz Feed called it “The best educational YouTube channel!” 

If your child is not meeting milestones, let your pediatrician know and call Early Intervention for your state. Your child may qualify for free or very low cost therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy. You can also contact a private speech therapist (speech language pathologist) for an evaluation. It’s best to act early and get your child help as soon as possible.

Ms Rachel has packed so much important learning into this “Learn Animals with Ms Rachel” special! Not only does she teach farm animals, animal sounds, zoo animals, and baby animal names, she sneaks in learning concepts to prepare children for preschool, such as modeling “what questions,” gestures, first words, first sentences, 5 W Questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why) pretend play skills, counting, colors, shapes, numbers, letters and letter sounds! She includes fun nursery rhymes & kids songs that encourage movement and language development. She also teaches prepositions such as under, next to, on, behind, in and out! As always, you can count on Ms Rachel to encourage language, movement and engagement. She is a master at encouraging speech and making screen time active, not passive. This kind of screen time is more beneficial. Ms Rachel uses fun learning toys to engage and excite toddlers about learning and encourage speech.

The learning standards and milestones she encourages range from 9 month old milestones like clapping to 5 year old milestones such as using the words and phrases “behind” and “next to” correctly and asking and answering “why questions.” Young children will be challenged to learn more and older siblings can watch and learn together with little ones. “Songs for Littles” is better screen time for bright toddlers! Buzz Feed called it “The best educational YouTube channel!” 

If your child is not meeting milestones, let your pediatrician know and call Early Intervention for your state. Your child may qualify for free or very low cost therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy. You can also contact a private speech therapist (speech language pathologist) for an evaluation. It’s best to act early and get your child help as soon as possible. 

Songs in this video include: 

Old Macdonald Had A Farm
Five Little Ducks 
Mary Had A Little Lamb 
Walkin’ At The Zoo 
If You Should Meet An Elephant 
Hop Little Bunnies 
Tick Tock Cuckoo Clock 
5 Little Monkeys
Bananas Unite 
Do You Know What Shape This Is? 
Row, Row, Row Your Boat
Bingo 
Little Bo Peep 
1-20 Song
Itsy Bitsy Spider 
Ants Go Marching
ABCs
Plus more! 

Ms Rachel also teaches about taking care of our pets and being gentle with our pets! She teaches children about veterinarians. She also shows real pets and animals throughout the episode. The Old Macdonald Had A Farm with real animals will delight children and the Old MacDonald Baby Animals. Learn, grow and play along with Ms Rachel! Ms Rachel also learns about jungle animals and forest animals.

WY4y2OtlGgM,ASMR Videos,WY4y2OtlGgM,News and Current Events,France in crisis as riots escalate - BBC News,"The French government has said it is considering all options - including declaring a state of emergency -  after a third night of escalating violence and rioting in cities and towns across France.  

Hundreds of police were injured last night and more than 900 people arrested. Ministers asked for public transport across France tonight to be suspended, and some major events have been cancelled as the government tries to stop scenes like this taking place for the fourth night running.
 
The protests began in a Paris suburb on Tuesday when a police officer shot dead a 17-year-old boy of north African descent during a traffic stop in the Nanterre. Footage of the shooting was posted online.
 
The unrest quickly spread across France, fuelled by accusations of police racism and wider discrimination against minority communities.

Around 45,000 police officers have been deployed on the streets.

-voSeHaknkE,ASMR Videos,-voSeHaknkE,News and Current Events,"God, Magog, and the Antichrist: Understanding Current Events and the Biblical End Times","Prophecy expert and author Todd Hampson says it's incredibly ""compelling"" to watch current events unfold in a way he believes matches biblical events and end times theology. ""To think that all that had just started falling into place within the last decade, really,"" Hampson told CBN's Faithwire, explaining how modern events comport with biblical narratives. ""For years, people would teach on the Ezekiel 38 war and say, 'It's going to be Russia, Iran, and Turkey as the main players and a few other countries.'"" 

But the ""The Non-Prophet’s Guide to the Book of Daniel"" author said some critics wondered how Islamic nations like Iran and Turkey would combine efforts with a country like Russia. Hampson, though, said these partnerships are now very much coming to fruition. ""We see it happening. They literally have agreements right now,"" he said. ""Russia and Iran, for example, have military agreements because of the war in Ukraine, where they're officially ... tying themselves together, and they've gotten closer."" 

Hampson said there's understandable speculation around the Gog and Magog text found in Ezekiel 38, as definitive details aren't presented in Scripture. That said, many believe Russia is Magog, and that some of the aforementioned key nations will take part in these eschatological events. ""The most compelling thing is the fact that Russia, Iran, and Turkey are aligned right now,"" he said. ""And it even says in that prophecy that they'll come, they'll attack Israel from the north, from the mountains."" 

Hampson believes the ""stage [is] being so clearly set for that."" Israel's rebirth in 1948 is another event he believes is centered on prophetic Scripture, particularly Ezekiel's mention of the ""valley of dry bones"" in Ezekiel 37; this is seen as a prediction of Israel's rebirth. ""Every Old Testament prophet, except for Jonah, predicted that Israel would become a nation again in the last days, and that its people would be gathered from all over the world back to their original homeland,"" Hampson said. ""So, anybody who says Israel becoming a nation again in 1948 is not a fulfillment of prophecy is either twisting Scripture or ignoring Scripture."" 

Hampson also explored his beliefs about the antichrist, China, North Korea, and other nations and movements. Watch the interview for more.

Why did Yevgeny Prigozhin end the uprising? Is Russian President Vladimir Putin weakened? Could the rebellion be a Ukraine war ploy to redeploy Wagner fighters to Belarus? 

We answered viewers questions after Russia was thrown into turmoil, as Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin staged an apparent insurrection.

It is unclear what the future holds for Prigozhin, who has left Russia for Belarus, and what impact the events on recent days will have on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

GMNEL6LrjlI,ASMR Videos,WY4y2OtlGgM,News and Current Events,France in crisis as riots escalate - BBC News,"The French government has said it is considering all options - including declaring a state of emergency -  after a third night of escalating violence and rioting in cities and towns across France.  

Hundreds of police were injured last night and more than 900 people arrested. Ministers asked for public transport across France tonight to be suspended, and some major events have been cancelled as the government tries to stop scenes like this taking place for the fourth night running.
 
The protests began in a Paris suburb on Tuesday when a police officer shot dead a 17-year-old boy of north African descent during a traffic stop in the Nanterre. Footage of the shooting was posted online.
 
The unrest quickly spread across France, fuelled by accusations of police racism and wider discrimination against minority communities.

Around 45,000 police officers have been deployed on the streets.

GMNEL6LrjlI,ASMR Videos,-voSeHaknkE,News and Current Events,"God, Magog, and the Antichrist: Understanding Current Events and the Biblical End Times","Prophecy expert and author Todd Hampson says it's incredibly ""compelling"" to watch current events unfold in a way he believes matches biblical events and end times theology. ""To think that all that had just started falling into place within the last decade, really,"" Hampson told CBN's Faithwire, explaining how modern events comport with biblical narratives. ""For years, people would teach on the Ezekiel 38 war and say, 'It's going to be Russia, Iran, and Turkey as the main players and a few other countries.'"" 

But the ""The Non-Prophet’s Guide to the Book of Daniel"" author said some critics wondered how Islamic nations like Iran and Turkey would combine efforts with a country like Russia. Hampson, though, said these partnerships are now very much coming to fruition. ""We see it happening. They literally have agreements right now,"" he said. ""Russia and Iran, for example, have military agreements because of the war in Ukraine, where they're officially ... tying themselves together, and they've gotten closer."" 

Hampson said there's understandable speculation around the Gog and Magog text found in Ezekiel 38, as definitive details aren't presented in Scripture. That said, many believe Russia is Magog, and that some of the aforementioned key nations will take part in these eschatological events. ""The most compelling thing is the fact that Russia, Iran, and Turkey are aligned right now,"" he said. ""And it even says in that prophecy that they'll come, they'll attack Israel from the north, from the mountains.""

Why did Yevgeny Prigozhin end the uprising? Is Russian President Vladimir Putin weakened? Could the rebellion be a Ukraine war ploy to redeploy Wagner fighters to Belarus? 

We answered viewers questions after Russia was thrown into turmoil, as Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin staged an apparent insurrection.

It is unclear what the future holds for Prigozhin, who has left Russia for Belarus, and what impact the events on recent days will have on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

8vdIfHsxqCg,ASMR Videos,WY4y2OtlGgM,News and Current Events,France in crisis as riots escalate - BBC News,"The French government has said it is considering all options - including declaring a state of emergency -  after a third night of escalating violence and rioting in cities and towns across France.  

Hundreds of police were injured last night and more than 900 people arrested. Ministers asked for public transport across France tonight to be suspended, and some major events have been cancelled as the government tries to stop scenes like this taking place for the fourth night running.
 
The protests began in a Paris suburb on Tuesday when a police officer shot dead a 17-year-old boy of north African descent during a traffic stop in the Nanterre. Footage of the shooting was posted online.
 
The unrest quickly spread across France, fuelled by accusations of police racism and wider discrimination against minority communities.

Around 45,000 police officers have been deployed on the streets.

8vdIfHsxqCg,ASMR Videos,-voSeHaknkE,News and Current Events,"God, Magog, and the Antichrist: Understanding Current Events and the Biblical End Times","Prophecy expert and author Todd Hampson says it's incredibly ""compelling"" to watch current events unfold in a way he believes matches biblical events and end times theology. ""To think that all that had just started falling into place within the last decade, really,"" Hampson told CBN's Faithwire, explaining how modern events comport with biblical narratives. ""For years, people would teach on the Ezekiel 38 war and say, 'It's going to be Russia, Iran, and Turkey as the main players and a few other countries.'"" 

But the ""The Non-Prophet’s Guide to the Book of Daniel"" author said some critics wondered how Islamic nations like Iran and Turkey would combine efforts with a country like Russia. Hampson, though, said these partnerships are now very much coming to fruition. ""We see it happening. They literally have agreements right now,"" he said. ""Russia and Iran, for example, have military agreements because of the war in Ukraine, where they're officially ... tying themselves together, and they've gotten closer."" 

Hampson said there's understandable speculation around the Gog and Magog text found in Ezekiel 38, as definitive details aren't presented in Scripture. That said, many believe Russia is Magog, and that some of the aforementioned key nations will take part in these eschatological events. ""The most compelling thing is the fact that Russia, Iran, and Turkey are aligned right now,"" he said. ""And it even says in that prophecy that they'll come, they'll attack Israel from the north, from the mountains."" 

Hampson believes the ""stage [is] being so clearly set for that."" Israel's rebirth in 1948 is another event he believes is centered on prophetic Scripture, particularly Ezekiel's mention of the ""valley of dry bones"" in Ezekiel 37; this is seen as a prediction of Israel's rebirth. ""Every Old Testament prophet, except for Jonah, predicted that Israel would become a nation again in the last days, and that its people would be gathered from all over the world back to their original homeland,"" Hampson said. ""So, anybody who says Israel becoming a nation again in 1948 is not a fulfillment of prophecy is either twisting Scripture or ignoring Scripture."" 

Hampson also explored his beliefs about the antichrist, China, North Korea, and other nations and movements. Watch the interview for more.

Japan's history as old and rich as any, and is strongly influenced by its geography, an island chain isolated at the end of the Eurasian continent. Its origins begin in the myths of the first Emperor of Japan, with recorded history beginning in the with the Yamato state of the 1st Century AD. Buddhism came to Japan in the 6th Century and fused with the native Shinto religion, which has continued to this day. Various dynasties went forward in the Asuka Period, the Nara Period where the capital of Japan moved to Kyoto, the Heian Period and the Kofun Period where the power of the Shogun, a military commander with greater power than the Emperor began.

But the Shogun's power waned until by the 15th Century, competing warlords (""Daimyo"") fought each other in what became known as the Sengoku Period (""Warring States""). Samurai warriors, who ruled their lives by the Bushido Code, fought each other for 150 years. Oda Nobunaga was the one who ultimately triumphed out of the chaos, but he was soon assassinated, and his successor Tokugawa Ieyasu became Shogun after one final contest, the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogun Tokugawa moved his court to Edo, later renamed Tokyo, and for the next 250 years, peace and isolation reigned in this Edo Period, as foreigners were expelled.

The Edo Period came to an end in 1860 as Admiral Perry of the USA forced Japan to open up. The Shogun was deposed and the emperor restored to power in what became known as the Meiji Restoration. In the next few decades, Japan went from a feudal society to a modern industrialised nation. But this progress was overshadowed by the rise of ultra-nationalist politicians under Hideki Tojo, who invaded China, leading to the Nanking Massacre, and the entry of Japan into World War II. The Empire of Japan was short lived, however, as Great Britain and the USA pushed back its forces, and the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the unimaginable surrender of the country in August 1945.

Since the war, the Japanese Economic Miracle took place, as Japan went from ruins to the #2 Economy in the world by the early 1970s. It soon dominated electronics, robotics and automotive sectors, with Japanese brands such as Sony, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Canon and Panasonic becoming household names.

The geography of Japan comprises four main islands Hokkaido in the north, the largest island of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu in the south. Okinawa is also notable, part of the Ryukyu island chain that extends as far as Taiwan. Earthquakes are a continual menace to Japan, with the most recent devastating Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 resulting in a devastating tsunami that led to the loss of 10,000s and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima.

Japanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world. It has a rich tradition of martial arts, from samurai to judo, karate to sumo. Its cuisine of ramen, sushi, teppan and teriyaki is sophisticated and popular the world over. Manga and anime are the latest globally desired trend of a tradition of centuries of illustration. Japanese strength in both electronics, art and story-telling resulted in its early entry into video games, which it continues to dominate to the present.

Japanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world. It has a rich tradition of martial arts, from samurai to judo, karate to sumo. Its cuisine of ramen, sushi, teppan and teriyaki is sophisticated and popular the world over. Manga and anime are the latest globally desired trend of a tradition of centuries of illustration. Japanese strength in both electronics, art and story-telling resulted in its early entry into video games, which it continues to dominate to the present.

In this video, I explore the long and unique history of Japan, the diverse geography of Japan - an archipelago of mountains, forests and volcanoes, the Japanese Economy - perhaps the most sophisticated in the world, and the remarkably rich Japanese culture that has influenced the world in so many ways.

Japan's history as old and rich as any, and is strongly influenced by its geography, an island chain isolated at the end of the Eurasian continent. Its origins begin in the myths of the first Emperor of Japan, with recorded history beginning in the with the Yamato state of the 1st Century AD. Buddhism came to Japan in the 6th Century and fused with the native Shinto religion, which has continued to this day. Various dynasties went forward in the Asuka Period, the Nara Period where the capital of Japan moved to Kyoto, the Heian Period and the Kofun Period where the power of the Shogun, a military commander with greater power than the Emperor began.

But the Shogun's power waned until by the 15th Century, competing warlords (""Daimyo"") fought each other in what became known as the Sengoku Period (""Warring States""). Samurai warriors, who ruled their lives by the Bushido Code, fought each other for 150 years. Oda Nobunaga was the one who ultimately triumphed out of the chaos, but he was soon assassinated, and his successor Tokugawa Ieyasu became Shogun after one final contest, the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogun Tokugawa moved his court to Edo, later renamed Tokyo, and for the next 250 years, peace and isolation reigned in this Edo Period, as foreigners were expelled.

The Edo Period came to an end in 1860 as Admiral Perry of the USA forced Japan to open up. The Shogun was deposed and the emperor restored to power in what became known as the Meiji Restoration. In the next few decades, Japan went from a feudal society to a modern industrialised nation. But this progress was overshadowed by the rise of ultra-nationalist politicians under Hideki Tojo, who invaded China, leading to the Nanking Massacre, and the entry of Japan into World War II. The Empire of Japan was short lived, however, as Great Britain and the USA pushed back its forces, and the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the unimaginable surrender of the country in August 1945.

Since the war, the Japanese Economic Miracle took place, as Japan went from ruins to the #2 Economy in the world by the early 1970s. It soon dominated electronics, robotics and automotive sectors, with Japanese brands such as Sony, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Canon and Panasonic becoming household names.

The geography of Japan comprises four main islands Hokkaido in the north, the largest island of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu in the south. Okinawa is also notable, part of the Ryukyu island chain that extends as far as Taiwan. Earthquakes are a continual menace to Japan, with the most recent devastating Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 resulting in a devastating tsunami that led to the loss of 10,000s and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima.

Japanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world.

B3QAfYHyiUI,ASMR Videos,B3QAfYHyiUI,Cultural and Historical Content,English Literature | Modernism: historical/cultural background and new literary techniques,"Modernism is a cultural, phylosophical and artistic movement that develops in the first half of the 20th century. It is influenced by an historical, political and
econpmical background that shatters the certainties of the human being: the two World Wars, the rise of totalitarianisms, the depression and the increasing 
unemployment are only some of the major dramatic events of the time.
While Ireland and suffragettes fought for their rights, intellectuals suffer from an existencial disorientation, the disgrefation of their identity and an individual 
alienation.
Literarure is obviously influenced by this crisis and develops new ""interior plots"", focused on the psychological side of the human being, instead of ""exterior plots"", 
based on action. New techniques like the stream of consciousness, the free association and the interior monologue are used by the authors of the time, like James Joyce and 
Virginia Woolf.

Japan's history as old and rich as any, and is strongly influenced by its geography, an island chain isolated at the end of the Eurasian continent. Its origins begin in the myths of the first Emperor of Japan, with recorded history beginning in the with the Yamato state of the 1st Century AD. Buddhism came to Japan in the 6th Century and fused with the native Shinto religion, which has continued to this day. Various dynasties went forward in the Asuka Period, the Nara Period where the capital of Japan moved to Kyoto, the Heian Period and the Kofun Period where the power of the Shogun, a military commander with greater power than the Emperor began.

But the Shogun's power waned until by the 15th Century, competing warlords (""Daimyo"") fought each other in what became known as the Sengoku Period (""Warring States""). Samurai warriors, who ruled their lives by the Bushido Code, fought each other for 150 years. Oda Nobunaga was the one who ultimately triumphed out of the chaos, but he was soon assassinated, and his successor Tokugawa Ieyasu became Shogun after one final contest, the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogun Tokugawa moved his court to Edo, later renamed Tokyo, and for the next 250 years, peace and isolation reigned in this Edo Period, as foreigners were expelled.

The Edo Period came to an end in 1860 as Admiral Perry of the USA forced Japan to open up. The Shogun was deposed and the emperor restored to power in what became known as the Meiji Restoration. In the next few decades, Japan went from a feudal society to a modern industrialised nation. But this progress was overshadowed by the rise of ultra-nationalist politicians under Hideki Tojo, who invaded China, leading to the Nanking Massacre, and the entry of Japan into World War II. The Empire of Japan was short lived, however, as Great Britain and the USA pushed back its forces, and the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the unimaginable surrender of the country in August 1945.

Since the war, the Japanese Economic Miracle took place, as Japan went from ruins to the #2 Economy in the world by the early 1970s. It soon dominated electronics, robotics and automotive sectors, with Japanese brands such as Sony, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Canon and Panasonic becoming household names.

The geography of Japan comprises four main islands Hokkaido in the north, the largest island of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu in the south. Okinawa is also notable, part of the Ryukyu island chain that extends as far as Taiwan. Earthquakes are a continual menace to Japan, with the most recent devastating Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 resulting in a devastating tsunami that led to the loss of 10,000s and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima.

Japanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world. It has a rich tradition of martial arts, from samurai to judo, karate to sumo. Its cuisine of ramen, sushi, teppan and teriyaki is sophisticated and popular the world over. Manga and anime are the latest globally desired trend of a tradition of centuries of illustration. Japanese strength in both electronics, art and story-telling resulted in its early entry into video games, which it continues to dominate to the present.

In this video, I explore the long and unique history of Japan, the diverse geography of Japan - an archipelago of mountains, forests and volcanoes, the Japanese Economy - perhaps the most sophisticated in the world, and the remarkably rich Japanese culture that has influenced the world in so many ways.

Japan's history as old and rich as any, and is strongly influenced by its geography, an island chain isolated at the end of the Eurasian continent. Its origins begin in the myths of the first Emperor of Japan, with recorded history beginning in the with the Yamato state of the 1st Century AD. Buddhism came to Japan in the 6th Century and fused with the native Shinto religion, which has continued to this day. Various dynasties went forward in the Asuka Period, the Nara Period where the capital of Japan moved to Kyoto, the Heian Period and the Kofun Period where the power of the Shogun, a military commander with greater power than the Emperor began.

But the Shogun's power waned until by the 15th Century, competing warlords (""Daimyo"") fought each other in what became known as the Sengoku Period (""Warring States""). Samurai warriors, who ruled their lives by the Bushido Code, fought each other for 150 years. Oda Nobunaga was the one who ultimately triumphed out of the chaos, but he was soon assassinated, and his successor Tokugawa Ieyasu became Shogun after one final contest, the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogun Tokugawa moved his court to Edo, later renamed Tokyo, and for the next 250 years, peace and isolation reigned in this Edo Period, as foreigners were expelled.

The Edo Period came to an end in 1860 as Admiral Perry of the USA forced Japan to open up. The Shogun was deposed and the emperor restored to power in what became known as the Meiji Restoration. In the next few decades, Japan went from a feudal society to a modern industrialised nation. But this progress was overshadowed by the rise of ultra-nationalist politicians under Hideki Tojo, who invaded China, leading to the Nanking Massacre, and the entry of Japan into World War II. The Empire of Japan was short lived, however, as Great Britain and the USA pushed back its forces, and the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the unimaginable surrender of the country in August 1945.

Since the war, the Japanese Economic Miracle took place, as Japan went from ruins to the #2 Economy in the world by the early 1970s. It soon dominated electronics, robotics and automotive sectors, with Japanese brands such as Sony, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Canon and Panasonic becoming household names.

The geography of Japan comprises four main islands Hokkaido in the north, the largest island of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu in the south. Okinawa is also notable, part of the Ryukyu island chain that extends as far as Taiwan. Earthquakes are a continual menace to Japan, with the most recent devastating Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 resulting in a devastating tsunami that led to the loss of 10,000s and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima.

Japanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world. It has a rich tradition of martial arts, from samurai to judo, karate to sumo. Its cuisine of ramen, sushi, teppan and teriyaki is sophisticated and popular the world over. Manga and anime are the latest globally desired trend of a tradition of centuries of illustration. Japanese strength in both electronics, art and story-telling resulted in its early entry into video games, which it continues to dominate to the present.

ys6xUugCmF8,ASMR Videos,B3QAfYHyiUI,Cultural and Historical Content,English Literature | Modernism: historical/cultural background and new literary techniques,"Modernism is a cultural, phylosophical and artistic movement that develops in the first half of the 20th century. It is influenced by an historical, political and
econpmical background that shatters the certainties of the human being: the two World Wars, the rise of totalitarianisms, the depression and the increasing 
unemployment are only some of the major dramatic events of the time.
While Ireland and suffragettes fought for their rights, intellectuals suffer from an existencial disorientation, the disgrefation of their identity and an individual 
alienation.
Literarure is obviously influenced by this crisis and develops new ""interior plots"", focused on the psychological side of the human being, instead of ""exterior plots"", 
based on action. New techniques like the stream of consciousness, the free association and the interior monologue are used by the authors of the time, like James Joyce and 
Virginia Woolf.

OkxRzvWqmpg,ASMR Videos,B3QAfYHyiUI,Cultural and Historical Content,English Literature | Modernism: historical/cultural background and new literary techniques,"Modernism is a cultural, phylosophical and artistic movement that develops in the first half of the 20th century. It is influenced by an historical, political and
econpmical background that shatters the certainties of the human being: the two World Wars, the rise of totalitarianisms, the depression and the increasing 
unemployment are only some of the major dramatic events of the time.
While Ireland and suffragettes fought for their rights, intellectuals suffer from an existencial disorientation, the disgrefation of their identity and an individual 
alienation.
Literarure is obviously influenced by this crisis and develops new ""interior plots"", focused on the psychological side of the human being, instead of ""exterior plots"", 
based on action. New techniques like the stream of consciousness, the free association and the interior monologue are used by the authors of the time, like James Joyce and 
Virginia Woolf.

In this video, I explore the long and unique history of Japan, the diverse geography of Japan - an archipelago of mountains, forests and volcanoes, the Japanese Economy - perhaps the most sophisticated in the world, and the remarkably rich Japanese culture that has influenced the world in so many ways.

Japan's history as old and rich as any, and is strongly influenced by its geography, an island chain isolated at the end of the Eurasian continent. Its origins begin in the myths of the first Emperor of Japan, with recorded history beginning in the with the Yamato state of the 1st Century AD. Buddhism came to Japan in the 6th Century and fused with the native Shinto religion, which has continued to this day. Various dynasties went forward in the Asuka Period, the Nara Period where the capital of Japan moved to Kyoto, the Heian Period and the Kofun Period where the power of the Shogun, a military commander with greater power than the Emperor began.

But the Shogun's power waned until by the 15th Century, competing warlords (""Daimyo"") fought each other in what became known as the Sengoku Period (""Warring States""). Samurai warriors, who ruled their lives by the Bushido Code, fought each other for 150 years. Oda Nobunaga was the one who ultimately triumphed out of the chaos, but he was soon assassinated, and his successor Tokugawa Ieyasu became Shogun after one final contest, the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogun Tokugawa moved his court to Edo, later renamed Tokyo, and for the next 250 years, peace and isolation reigned in this Edo Period, as foreigners were expelled.

The Edo Period came to an end in 1860 as Admiral Perry of the USA forced Japan to open up. The Shogun was deposed and the emperor restored to power in what became known as the Meiji Restoration. In the next few decades, Japan went from a feudal society to a modern industrialised nation. But this progress was overshadowed by the rise of ultra-nationalist politicians under Hideki Tojo, who invaded China, leading to the Nanking Massacre, and the entry of Japan into World War II. The Empire of Japan was short lived, however, as Great Britain and the USA pushed back its forces, and the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the unimaginable surrender of the country in August 1945.

Since the war, the Japanese Economic Miracle took place, as Japan went from ruins to the #2 Economy in the world by the early 1970s. It soon dominated electronics, robotics and automotive sectors, with Japanese brands such as Sony, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Canon and Panasonic becoming household names.

The geography of Japan comprises four main islands Hokkaido in the north, the largest island of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu in the south. Okinawa is also notable, part of the Ryukyu island chain that extends as far as Taiwan. Earthquakes are a continual menace to Japan, with the most recent devastating Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 resulting in a devastating tsunami that led to the loss of 10,000s and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima.

Japanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world. It has a rich tradition of martial arts, from samurai to judo, karate to sumo. Its cuisine of ramen, sushi, teppan and teriyaki is sophisticated and popular the world over. Manga and anime are the latest globally desired trend of a tradition of centuries of illustration. Japanese strength in both electronics, art and story-telling resulted in its early entry into video games, which it continues to dominate to the present.

KagTtxJf4d0,ASMR Videos,uQX8UwV87Os,Cultural and Historical Content,"Japan: History, Geography, Economy & Culture","This is the story of Japan. In this video, I explore the long and unique history of Japan, the diverse geography of Japan - an archipelago of mountains, forests and volcanoes, the Japanese Economy - perhaps the most sophisticated in the world, and the remarkably rich Japanese culture that has influenced the world in so many ways.

Japan's history as old and rich as any, and is strongly influenced by its geography, an island chain isolated at the end of the Eurasian continent. Its origins begin in the myths of the first Emperor of Japan, with recorded history beginning in the with the Yamato state of the 1st Century AD. Buddhism came to Japan in the 6th Century and fused with the native Shinto religion, which has continued to this day. Various dynasties went forward in the Asuka Period, the Nara Period where the capital of Japan moved to Kyoto, the Heian Period and the Kofun Period where the power of the Shogun, a military commander with greater power than the Emperor began.

But the Shogun's power waned until by the 15th Century, competing warlords (""Daimyo"") fought each other in what became known as the Sengoku Period (""Warring States""). Samurai warriors, who ruled their lives by the Bushido Code, fought each other for 150 years. Oda Nobunaga was the one who ultimately triumphed out of the chaos, but he was soon assassinated, and his successor Tokugawa Ieyasu became Shogun after one final contest, the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogun Tokugawa moved his court to Edo, later renamed Tokyo, and for the next 250 years, peace and isolation reigned in this Edo Period, as foreigners were expelled.

The Edo Period came to an end in 1860 as Admiral Perry of the USA forced Japan to open up. The Shogun was deposed and the emperor restored to power in what became known as the Meiji Restoration. In the next few decades, Japan went from a feudal society to a modern industrialised nation. But this progress was overshadowed by the rise of ultra-nationalist politicians under Hideki Tojo, who invaded China, leading to the Nanking Massacre, and the entry of Japan into World War II. The Empire of Japan was short lived, however, as Great Britain and the USA pushed back its forces, and the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the unimaginable surrender of the country in August 1945.

Since the war, the Japanese Economic Miracle took place, as Japan went from ruins to the #2 Economy in the world by the early 1970s. It soon dominated electronics, robotics and automotive sectors, with Japanese brands such as Sony, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Canon and Panasonic becoming household names.

The geography of Japan comprises four main islands Hokkaido in the north, the largest island of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu in the south. Okinawa is also notable, part of the Ryukyu island chain that extends as far as Taiwan. Earthquakes are a continual menace to Japan, with the most recent devastating Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 resulting in a devastating tsunami that led to the loss of 10,000s and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima.

Japanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world. It has a rich tradition of martial arts, from samurai to judo, karate to sumo. Its cuisine of ramen, sushi, teppan and teriyaki is sophisticated and popular the world over. Manga and anime are the latest globally desired trend of a tradition of centuries of illustration. Japanese strength in both electronics, art and story-telling resulted in its early entry into video games, which it continues to dominate to the present.

KagTtxJf4d0,ASMR Videos,B3QAfYHyiUI,Cultural and Historical Content,English Literature | Modernism: historical/cultural background and new literary techniques,"Modernism is a cultural, phylosophical and artistic movement that develops in the first half of the 20th century. It is influenced by an historical, political and
econpmical background that shatters the certainties of the human being: the two World Wars, the rise of totalitarianisms, the depression and the increasing 
unemployment are only some of the major dramatic events of the time.
While Ireland and suffragettes fought for their rights, intellectuals suffer from an existencial disorientation, the disgrefation of their identity and an individual 
alienation.
Literarure is obviously influenced by this crisis and develops new ""interior plots"", focused on the psychological side of the human being, instead of ""exterior plots"", 
based on action. New techniques like the stream of consciousness, the free association and the interior monologue are used by the authors of the time, like James Joyce and 
Virginia Woolf.
